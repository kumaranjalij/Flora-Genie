Available in colour from Nov to March.,"Most Poinsettia plants are sold when in full color. After getting a Poinsettia home it should be watered thoroughly. The plant can be kept indoors for a few weeks. A bright spot with good air movement is best. Low light will result in the bottom leaves turning yellow and falling off. Water the plants only when the soil becomes dry. Always give enough water so that at least half the quantity given drains off from the bottom of the pot. The color of the bracts lasts from November to April. After the bracts fade the plants should be shifted to the outdoor garden., GROWING THE POINSETTIA AFTER COLOR HAS FADED., The Poinsettia is a short day plant. This means that it flowers (develops color) when the days become short and nights become long. This naturally happens with us in winter. Once summer comes and the days become longer the Poinsettia begins to develop its green leaves. The plant then goes into its growing phase. The plant should be placed in a well-lit location. Full sunlight is also okay. Prune the Poinsettia plant in July first week to half the flowering height required. (If you want the plant to be 60 cms high then cut it down to 30 cms.) In case repotting is to be done it should be done in June. Use a big pot (30 cms will do) in case you want to grow a large specimen) Pinch (remove the growing tip) to encourage branching. The plants can be pinched after 5 to 6 leaves develop. Pinching will result in a bushy and rounded plant. Do not pinch after 15th August as it may interfere with the color development. The Poinsettia is a quick grower, fertilizers will help it grow better. Use any water-soluble fertilizers as per instructions given on the label., Recently, A WORD OF CAUTION., As mentioned earlier Poinsettias require a long night to induce flowering. Street Lighting or Garden Lights can disturb this long night. If Poinsettias get any type of artificial light at night they will not flower. So make sure they get totally dark nights., Last but last the least.

From its humble origins in Mexico it has come a long way to brighten up our surroundings. The Poinsettia plants provides spectacular color during the winter season. The colored leaves of the Poinsettia develop when the plants are going to flower. These are called the Bracts. True flowers are small yellow-green and are in the center of the Bracts. The Poinsettias are synonymous with the Christmas and New year celebrations. Their arrival heralds the onset of festivities. Poinsettias are also an excellent outdoor plants. They can be planted in the outdoor garden for a sensational color impact during winter.,"Most Poinsettia plants are sold when in full color. After getting a Poinsettia home it should be watered thoroughly. The plant can be kept indoors for a few weeks. A bright spot with good air movement is best. Low light will result in the bottom leaves turning yellow and falling off. Water the plants only when the soil becomes dry. Always give enough water so that at least half the quantity given drains off from the bottom of the pot. The color of the bracts lasts from November to April. After the bracts fade the plants should be shifted to the outdoor garden., GROWING THE POINSETTIA AFTER COLOR HAS FADED., The Poinsettia is a short day plant. This means that it flowers (develops color) when the days become short and nights become long. This naturally happens with us in winter. Once summer comes and the days become longer the Poinsettia begins to develop its green leaves. The plant then goes into its growing phase. The plant should be placed in a well-lit location. Full sunlight is also okay. Prune the Poinsettia plant in July first week to half the flowering height required. (If you want the plant to be 60 cms high then cut it down to 30 cms.) In case repotting is to be done it should be done in June. Use a big pot (30 cms will do) in case you want to grow a large specimen) Pinch (remove the growing tip) to encourage branching. The plants can be pinched after 5 to 6 leaves develop. Pinching will result in a bushy and rounded plant. Do not pinch after 15th August as it may interfere with the color development. The Poinsettia is a quick grower, fertilizers will help it grow better. Use any water-soluble fertilizers as per instructions given on the label., Recently, A WORD OF CAUTION., As mentioned earlier Poinsettias require a long night to induce flowering. Street Lighting or Garden Lights can disturb this long night. If Poinsettias get any type of artificial light at night they will not flower. So make sure they get totally dark nights., Last but last the least.

From its humble origins in Mexico it has come a long way to brighten up our surroundings. The Poinsettia plants provides spectacular color during the winter season. The colored leaves of the Poinsettia develop when the plants are going to flower. These are called the Bracts. True flowers are small yellow-green and are in the center of the Bracts. The Poinsettias are synonymous with the Christmas and New year celebrations. Their arrival heralds the onset of festivities. Poinsettias are also an excellent outdoor plants. They can be planted in the outdoor garden for a sensational color impact during winter.,"Most Poinsettia plants are sold when in full color. After getting a Poinsettia home it should be watered thoroughly. The plant can be kept indoors for a few weeks. A bright spot with good air movement is best. Low light will result in the bottom leaves turning yellow and falling off. Water the plants only when the soil becomes dry. Always give enough water so that at least half the quantity given drains off from the bottom of the pot. The color of the bracts lasts from November to April. After the bracts fade the plants should be shifted to the outdoor garden., GROWING THE POINSETTIA AFTER COLOR HAS FADED., The Poinsettia is a short day plant. This means that it flowers (develops color) when the days become short and nights become long. This naturally happens with us in winter. Once summer comes and the days become longer the Poinsettia begins to develop its green leaves. The plant then goes into its growing phase. The plant should be placed in a well-lit location. Full sunlight is also okay. Prune the Poinsettia plant in July first week to half the flowering height required. (If you want the plant to be 60 cms high then cut it down to 30 cms.) In case repotting is to be done it should be done in June. Use a big pot (30 cms will do) in case you want to grow a large specimen) Pinch (remove the growing tip) to encourage branching. The plants can be pinched after 5 to 6 leaves develop. Pinching will result in a bushy and rounded plant. Do not pinch after 15th August as it may interfere with the color development. The Poinsettia is a quick grower, fertilizers will help it grow better. Use any water-soluble fertilizers as per instructions given on the label., Recently, A WORD OF CAUTION., As mentioned earlier Poinsettias require a long night to induce flowering. Street Lighting or Garden Lights can disturb this long night. If Poinsettias get any type of artificial light at night they will not flower. So make sure they get totally dark nights., Last but last the least.

It is also easier to remove these small pots and clean the pool or tub., It is always better to buy or get new plants already planted in these inner pots. Getting plants dug out from the clay damages a lot of roots., For planting use only clay. Do not use any manure., A minimum pot size of 25 cms should be used. Bigger the better., There should be a minimum of 25 cms of water depth above the pot level., The water depth above the pot can be as much as 100 cms., Never apply any fertilizers directly to the water. High nitrogen in the water will cause excessive algae to grow and make the water dirty., Specially made tablets should be used. These should be pressed deep into the clayey soil. This enables the roots to take up the nutrition directly., Clean the water once every 2 to 3 months., It is a very good idea to add guppy fish to the water. These eat all the mosquito larve and keep the water clean., Two or more different varieties are not usually put in the same pool. They have different growth vigor and usually the weaker ones get somthered out. Planting far apart in large pools is fine., In extreme cold the plants may go into dormancy. Keep them as they are and they will sprout back in spring or summer.","['Scraped_Images/2584_Nymphaea alba malaysian white/Nymphaea alba malaysian white_0.jpg', 'Scraped_Images/2584_Nymphaea alba malaysian white/Nymphaea alba malaysian white_1.jpg', 'Scraped_Images/2584_Nymphaea alba malaysian white/Nymphaea alba malaysian white_2.jpg', 'Scraped_Images/2584_Nymphaea alba malaysian white/Nymphaea alba malaysian white_3.jpg', 'Scraped_Images/2584_Nymphaea alba malaysian white/Nymphaea alba malaysian white_4.jpg']"

High nitrogen in the water will cause excessive algae to grow and make the water dirty., Specially made tablets should be used. These should be pressed deep into the clayey soil. This enables the roots to take up the nutrition directly., Clean the water once every 2 to 3 months., It is a very good idea to add guppy fish to the water. These eat all the mosquito larve and keep the water clean., Two or more different varieties are not usually put in the same pool. They have different growth vigor and usually the weaker ones get somthered out. Planting far apart in large pools is fine., In extreme cold the plants may go into dormancy.

From its humble origins in Mexico it has come a long way to brighten up our surroundings. The Poinsettia plants provides spectacular color during the winter season. The colored leaves of the Poinsettia develop when the plants are going to flower. These are called the Bracts. True flowers are small yellow-green and are in the center of the Bracts. The Poinsettias are synonymous with the Christmas and New year celebrations. Their arrival heralds the onset of festivities. Poinsettias are also excellent outdoor plants. They can be planted in the outdoor garden for a sensational color impact during winter.,"Most Poinsettia plants are sold when in full color., After getting a Poinsettia home it should be watered thoroughly., The plant can be kept indoors for a few weeks., A bright spot with good air movement is best. Low light will result in the bottom leaves turning yellow and falling off., Water the plants only when the soil becomes dry. Always give enough water so that at least half the quantity given drains off from the bottom of the pot., The color of the bracts lasts from November to April. For some early flowering varieties it is from October to MArch., After the bracts fade the plants should be shifted to the outdoor garden., GROWING THE POINSETTIA AFTER COLOR HAS FADED., The Poinsettia is a short day plant. This means that it flowers (develops color) when the days become short and nights become long. This naturally happens with us in winter., Once summer comes and the days become longer the Poinsettia begins to develop its green leaves. The plant then goes into its growing phase. The plant should be placed in a well-lit location with a minimum of half a day\\\\\\\'s sun. Full sunlight is also okay., Prune the Poinsettia plant in July first week to half the flowering height required. (If you want the plant to be 60 cms high then cut it down to 30 cms.), In case repotting is to be done it should be done in June. Use a big pot (30 cms will do) in case you want to grow a large specimen), Pinch (remove the growing tip) to encourage branching. The plants can be pinched after 5 to 6 leaves develop., Pinching will result in a bushy and rounded plant. Do not pinch after 15th August as it may interfere with the color development., The Poinsettia is a quick grower, fertilizers will help it grow better. Use any water-soluble fertilizers as per instructions given on the label., Recently, A WORD OF CAUTION., As mentioned earlier Poinsettias require a long night to induce flowering. Street Lighting or Garden Lights can disturb this long night. If Poinsettias get any type of artificial light at night they will not flower. So make sure they get totally dark nights., Last but last the least.

Full sunlight is also okay. Prune the Poinsettia plant in July first week to half the flowering height required. (If you want the plant to be 60 cms high then cut it down to 30 cms.) In case repotting is to be done it should be done in June. Use a big pot (30 cms will do) in case you want to grow a large specimen) Pinch (remove the growing tip) to encourage branching. The plants can be pinched after 5 to 6 leaves develop. Pinching will result in a bushy and rounded plant. Do not pinch after 15th August as it may interfere with the color development. The Poinsettia is a quick grower, fertilizers will help it grow better. Use any water-soluble fertilizers as per instructions given on the label., Recently, A WORD OF CAUTION., As mentioned earlier Poinsettias require a long night to induce flowering.

They are also known as zonal Geraniums due to the dark pattern on their leaves. The most common species that is grown today is Pelargonium hortorum. These are grown for their clusters of brilliantly colored flowers., They are one of the most popular and rewarding of flowering plants., These plants have succulent leaves and stem and may will to small shrub up to 60 cms., Leaves in most varieties are circular 2 - 3 inch in diameter., Leaves are 3 to 5 inch across dark green. Zonal varieties have a circular dark band on the leaves., Use in beds & borders., Good for use in window boxes – especially in milder climates.","Geraniums grow best in full sunlight.

They should be planted in large pots or in ground beds. Geraniums are one of the most popular plants for window boxes., The growing media (soil) used for Geraniums should be well drained and should have ample nutrients. The newer varieties of Geraniums flower a lot and therefore need a lot of food supply., The Geraniums grown today are of two basic types. Ones propagated from cuttings and ones grown from hybrid seed. The plants grown from cuttings in India are old varieties that grow taller and flower less. Plants grown from seed (hybrid seed) flower much more and tend to stay dwarf. A good color range is also available amongst the seed grown types. The only drawback is that the hybrid seeds are quite expensive. But the plants obtained are far superior and definitely value for money., Regular feeding with water-soluble fertilizers is required. Fertilizers recommended for flowering plants are suitable., Old and dry leaves should be cleaned from time to time. Remove all old faded flower bunches., Geraniums have a aromatic compound in their leaves and stems. Due to this most pests avoid them., There can be some fungal problems. Especially when humidity and temperatures are high., One secret of growing good geraniums is cleaning them regularly. Old flower blooms - that have bloomed over 80% can be removed. Also old dry leaves should be taken out.

So So for drinking water., There is also some confusion about tall and dwarf coconut trees. There are NO DWARF coconut trees. The ones that are called dwarf start bearing fruit early. (in 4 to 5 years). Even the so called dwarf trees eventually grow tall. (And as with swimming - any water above nose height is deep... any coconut above the reach of a ladder is tall)., The tall varieties are recommended for farm houses and farms where security is a problem. For the early bearing varieties the coconuts often are at ground level and subject to theft., The coconut plant is of uncertain origin. Since its seeds were dispersed by ocean currents - it has been found over a large area. How ever it is believed to have originated in South to South east Asia., As we all know - it is called the -kalpa vriksha or tree of life in India. It is worshipped and revered., each and every part of it is useful. The tree has been one of the pillars of human civilization., For home growers removing the husk used to be a major problem.

This is not required., There are many pests and diseases that affect the coconut tree. At the home level it is generally not sprayed., Manuring and fertilizers are important as they ensure adequate supply of nuts. It is important to understand that the time for fertilizer to translate into nuts is long. Do not expect results over night.
